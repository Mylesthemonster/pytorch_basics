| 0. Computer vision libraries in PyTorch | PyTorch has a bunch of built-in helpful computer vision libraries, let's check them out. |
| 1. Load data | To practice computer vision, we'll start with some images of different pieces of clothing from FashionMNIST. |
| 2. Prepare data | We've got some images, let's load them in with a PyTorch DataLoader so we can use them with our training loop. |
| 3. Model 0: Building a baseline model | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a loss function, optimizer and build a training loop. |
| 4. Making predictions and evaluting model 0 | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |
| 5. Setup device agnostic code for future models | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |
| 6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |
| 7. Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Time to get computer vision specific and introduce the powerful convolutional neural network architecture. |
| 8. Comparing our models | We've built three different models, let's compare them. |
| 9. Evaluating our best model | Let's make some predictons on random images and evaluate our best model. |
| 10. Making a confusion matrix | A confusion matrix is a great way to evaluate a classification model, let's see how we can make one. |
| 11. Saving and loading the best performing model | Since we might want to use our model for
